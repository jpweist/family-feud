            This special edition of Family Feud is a two-player experience.  <br>
            Each full game is made up of three seperate rounds.  <br>
            For every turn, alternate between Player 1 and Player 2. <br>
            Each player is asked a question that has  been surveyed to 100 people. <br>
            For each answer that matches anything in our survey responses, that player will recieve points proportional to the amount of respondents that had that same answer. <br> <br>

            The third round is a Fast Money round, where each player gets thirty seconds to provide as many responses as they can think of.
            The winner is determined by the player with the highest total score at the end of three rounds.
