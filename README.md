# The Epic Battle of Ninjas VS Zombies
The year is 2020. An unknown zombie virus has spread wildly across the Americas, Europe, and now Asia. These continents have very few survivors due to the takeover and a very small group of highly skilled professionals have banded together for the cause. You arise from your slumber in a cold dark alley. The game is to kill or be killed. Which side are you on?

Based off the TV show Family Feud. The game project technologies used: HTML, SCSS, JS, WebPack, Mocha Testing Framwork and Chai Assertion Library, along with the Fetch API.
